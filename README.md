- 👋 Hi, I’m Alexa (Amazon stole my name 😭) ⚜️🇨🇦.
- 👀 Besides coding, which I started learning this year (Feb 2022), my interests are reading 📚 (mostly fiction, but I enjoy a good non-fiction book here and there), learning about skincare 🧴, the MCU 🎥✨(now MCM?? - AoS is canon up to s3, fight me!), trying out new restaurants and dishes with my partner and friends 🤩, discovering natural wines and craft gins with my sister and mom 🍷🍸, and hanging out with my dog and cat 🐶🐱.
- ✍️ I’m currently learning to code, studying for the Ontario bar exam and learning to drive.
- 🌱 What I want to learn next: back end development 👩🏻‍💻, financial literacy 💱, a new language 💬, and the piano 🎹.
- 📫 How to reach me: linkedin.com/in/alexa-m-klein, @alexamklein on Instagram.
